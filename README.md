Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is a simple website that outlines the classes I have taken in each of my core subjects in High School.

The tables on the main page utilize the bootstrap column organization that also helps the page adapt to smaller screens.

The @media queries can be seen in the footer which shortens for a smaller window.
